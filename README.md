# Simple Sudoku Solver

Simple program written in C by me for solving $3 \times 3$ Sudoku.

## Usage

Create a file .txt named "sudoku_input" (with zeros in the places when there are blank spaces) and then the program will print on the screen the "parsed" sudoku and then it proceds to solve the sudoku and the results will be avaible on the screen and in a .txt file named "sudoku_output". See as example the file "sudoku_input.txt"
