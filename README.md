# Simple Sudoku Solver

Simple program written in C by me for solving $3 \times 3$ Sudoku.

## Usage

Create a file .txt named "sudoku_input" (with zeros in the places when there are blank spaces) and then the program will print on the screen the "parsed" sudoku and then it proceds to solve the sudoku. The results will be avaible on the screen and in a .txt file named "sudoku_output". See as example the file "sudoku_input.txt" to understand how it must be written the sudoku

Command-line argument:
* -h : display some brief information about the program and the other command-line argument
* -p: print the parsed sudoku and the solved sudoku on the screen (but they will, however, be saved in a .txt file);
* -pI: print the initial sudoku
* -pS: print the solved sudoku
