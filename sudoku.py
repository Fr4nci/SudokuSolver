"""
Code written in Python to solve Sudoku
The key idea is to implement the function using vary functions. The program is structured by solving 3 key problem:
*   Finding Unassigned Entry of the array (the zeros which are equivalent to the blank spaces of unresolved sudokus)
*   Checking if it is safe to put a number (there are not repetition in the coloumn, in the row or in the cell)
*   Checking for every cell every number
a is the sudoku matrix ~ sudoku is its name in the function
